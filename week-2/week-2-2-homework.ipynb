    "## Week 2-2 - Visualizing General Social Survey data\n",
    "\n",
    "Your mission is to analyze a data set of social attitudes by turning it into vectors, then visualizing the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Choose a topic and get your data\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to be working with data from the General Social Survey, which asks Americans thousands of questions ever year, over decades. This is an enormous data set and there have been very many stories written from its data. The first thing you need to do is decide which questions and which years you are going to try to analyze.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use their [data explorer](https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/) to see what's available, and ultimately download an Excel file with the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Click the `Search Varibles` button.\n",
    "- You will need at least a dozen or two related variables. Try selecting some using their `Filter by Module / Subject` interface.\n",
    "- When you've made your selection, click the `+ All` button to add all listed variables, then choose `Extract Data` under the `Actions` menu.\n",
    "- Then you have a multi-step process. Step 1 is just naming your extract\n",
    "- Step 2: select variables *again!* Click `Add All` in the upper right of the \"Variable Cart\" in the \"Choose Variables\" step.\n",
    "- Step 3: Skip it. You could use this to filter the data in various ways. \n",
    "- Step 4: Click `Select certain years` to pick one year of data, then check `Excel Workbook (data + metadata)` as the output format.\n",
    "- Click `Create Extract` and wait a minute or two on the \"Extracts\" page until the spinner stops and turns into a download link.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll end up with an compressed file in tar.gz format, which you should be able to decompressed by double-clicking on it. Inside is an Excel file. Open it in Excel (or your favorite spreadsheet program) and resave it as a CSV.\n",
