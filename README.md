# Algorithms - Lede 2018 
A course on algorithms for doing journalis.

## Course overview
This is a course on algorithmic data analysis in journalism. We will cover basic methods for working with large(ish) data sets, and a variety of techniques used in story production, from regression to simulation to machine learning.

There are basically two different ways algorithms are combined journalism: we can use algorithms to analyze data to produce stories, and as we can do stories about algorithms that affect people's lives. We will do both.

## Schedule 
This is a rough outline, and subject to change, but your homework assignments will always be up to date!

**Every Monday, you must bring in an algorithmic story to share with the class.**

Homework is due before the following class.


### Week 1 - Introduction to Algorithms
Algorithms for doing journalism, journalism about algorithms. The purpose of mathematical formalism. 
Homework:

- Use a Jypyter notebook to prove that an average of averages is not the same as the overall average. Similarly for median. 
- Work out when the overall average and an average of averages **are** equal, and prove formally that this must be so.
- Show that this really works, by computing the values in Jupyter.
- Repeat this exercise for the median.

### Week 2 - Text Processing
In this class we will develop the ubiquitous vector space document model, with TF-IDF weighting. You will learn to algorithmically summarize documents by extracting keywords, how to compare documents for similarity, and how a search engine and Google News work.

Homework:
- Analyze the State of the Union speeches in the 20th century to see how topics changed by decade (see notebook assignment)

### Week 3 - Regression

### Week 4 - Machine Learning

### Week 5 - Network Anaysis

### Week 6 - Simulations 1

### Week 7 - Simulations 2
