    "# Week 5-2: The social effects of using machine learning for lending decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses about a 10% sample of the [Lending Club data set](https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data) to examine the results of improved default prediction on who gets a loan and who doesn't. \n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis is inspired by the paper [Predictably Unequal? The Effects of Machine Learning on Credit Markets](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3072038) by Fuster et al.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more code that deals with machine learning on this data set, see [Predicting Loan Repayment](https://towardsdatascience.com/predicting-loan-repayment-5df4e0023e92).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is ~100k row subset of the ~900k records in the original data set. The subset over-samples defaulters enormously, so that repaid vs. defaulted is about 50/50. In the original data it's very much smaller, about 80:20. The preprocessing script does this intentionally, to make the numbers in this example easier to understand. As a side effect, this skews the income distributions because defaulters (who were previously granted a loan, if they're in this data set!) will have different characteristics from non-defaulters, or defaulters who were denied a loan. Another unrealistic thing is that a real loan issuer has some key information that isn't publicly available for privacy reasons, like FICO credit score. \n",
    "\n",
    "So **don't take this as reasearch on what the effect of machine learning on loan decisions will actually be.** This document is a learning tool, meant to demonstrate some ways that question could be explored. "
