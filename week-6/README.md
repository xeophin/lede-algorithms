## Week 6 - Simulations

Some simulations of note:

- [Should Prison Sentences Be Based On Crimes That Haven’t Been Committed Yet?](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/prison-reform-risk-assessment/) - Fivethirtyeight

- [Watch how the measles outbreak spreads when kids get vaccinated – and when they don't](https://www.theguardian.com/society/ng-interactive/2015/feb/05/-sp-watch-how-measles-outbreak-spreads-when-kids-get-vaccinated) - The Guardian

- [This game will show you just how foolish it is to sell stocks right now](https://qz.com/487013/this-game-will-show-you-just-how-foolish-it-is-to-sell-stocks-right-now/) - Quartz


- [How BuzzFeed News Used Betting Data To Investigate Match-Fixing In Tennis](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/johntemplon/how-we-used-data-to-investigate-match-fixing-in-tennis). See also the [code notebook](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2016-01-tennis-betting-analysis)!

- The Wall Street Journal's multi-decade investigation into insider trading has used simulation several times: [2006](http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/wall-street-journal)(read "How the journal analyzed stock-option grants"), [2013](http://businessjournalism.org/2013/11/bronze-from-casual-conversation-to-massive-investigation-into-insider-trading/), and [2017](https://www.wsj.com/articles/hundreds-of-people-made-gifts-of-stock-with-great-timing-1513881239)

- [Statistical Model Strongly Suggests the Stormy Daniels Payoff Came from the Trump Campaign](https://medium.com/@whstancil/statistical-model-strongly-suggests-the-stormy-daniels-payoff-came-from-the-trump-campaign-7c09c300cb18). This one has similar structure to The Tennis Racker but has been criticized on the grounds that if you take the previous 20 payments, as opposed to the previous 10, the probability of getting close to $130,000 is very much higher.
