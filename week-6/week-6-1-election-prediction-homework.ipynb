        "# Homework 6-1: \"Fundamentals\" based election prediction\n",
        "\n",
        "In this homework you will explore an alternate election prediction model, using various economic and political indicators instead of polling data -- and also deal with the challenges of model building when there is very little training data. Political scientists have long analyzed these types of \"fundamentals\" models, and they can be reasonably accurate. For example, fundamentals [slightly favored](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/it-wasnt-clintons-election-to-lose/) the Republicans in 2016\n",
        "\n",
        "Data sources which I used to generate `election-fundamentals.csv`:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Historical presidential approval ratings (highest and lowest for each president) from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_approval_rating) \n",
        "- GDP growth in election year from [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG?locations=US)\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that there are some timing issues here which more careful forecasts would avoid. The presidential approval rating is for the entire presidential term.The GDP growth is for the entire election year. These variables might have higher predictive power if they were (for example) sampled in the last quarters before the election.\n",
        "\nFor a comprehensive view of election prediction from non-poll data, and how well it might or might not be able to do, try [this](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/models-based-on-fundamentals-have-failed-at-predicting-presidential-elections/) from Fivethirtyeight."
